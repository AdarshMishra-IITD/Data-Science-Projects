# Objective: Predicting 12 months of data of Accedental death in USA using Time Series Analysis 

The dataset is provided with 2 columns:
Month, Accidental deaths in USA

Approach:

Visualise the Time series
Decomposing into trend, seasonal, cyclical and noise components
Analyze the seasonality of a Time Series: additive and multiplicative.
Check stationarity of data - Rolling Mean, ADCF Test(Augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller test)
Stationarize Time series - first differencing, log transformation and exponatial transformation
Plot ACF/PACF charts and find optimal parameters
Use auto Arima for estimating the optimal parameter 
Build Time series models according to data - AR, MA, ARIMA, SARIMA
Make predictions
MAPE,SMAPE as evaluation metric
